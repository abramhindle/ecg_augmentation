# To Do
- [ ] Settle on a dataset
- Approach:
	- [ ] use wavelets/FFT to compress signals (in windows)
		- [ ] check to see if we can recreate the data from this compressed form if so, it is logical that the compressed form is useful for classification
	- [ ] use transformers or LSTMs because they can learn from temporal data
		- [ ] give transformers all windows before making a classification
	- Advantage:
		- [ ] this way we do not need heartbeat annotations
		- [ ] we can use smote to make fake data
			- [ ] Does it improve classification?
